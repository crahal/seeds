### Introduction
Are you conducting academic research with a computational tool which has producues a different outcome each time? Great; you're then probably familiar with the idea of seeing a 'seed' to instantiate the random number generator which is causing this variance. Conventional wisdom (scant which it is) in the academic literature and online community forums (e.g. Stack OverFlow) generally and unreservedly advocate the setting of a seed to consistently generate the same result regardless of who runs, how it's run, or where the code which powers the analysis is ran from.

In this short perspective/review article, we rally against this suggestion. While being fully appreciatiative of the need for computational reproducibility as a critically important feature of the scientific record, it should in no way come at the expense of blindly assuming that the one, scalar estimand which comes out of our algorithm is invariant to the choice of the instantiating seed. Through a _large_ number of simulations, empirically driven teaching examples, and high profile replications, we describe and showcase instead what we believe to be a far more reasonable strategy in an era of not just high performance computing, but also vastly powerful personal computers.

### Code
In `./src/` you can find a number of scripts that conduct our computational (re-)analysis. This includes things like a re-examination of Buffon's Needle problem, forecasting the price of Bitcoin with a random walk, re-examination of existing Machine Learning work, and more generally inferential problems (such as the Fragile Families Challenge, Ehrlich's famous criminological study, and others). In `./assets/` you can find a large list of _pre-specified_ seeds (e.g. `./assets/seed_list.txt`) generated by `./src/seed_generator.py/`, generated with `int.from_bytes(secrets.token_bytes(4), 'big')`, constrained to be under 2147483647: the largest seed value accepted by `np.random()`. The requiements for this project can be installed via the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/crahal/seeds/blob/main/requirements.txt) file (i.e. `pip install -r requirements.txt`).

### Data
Most of the code comes self-contained; it generates simulated data, or pulls data down from the web. In two specific examples, it is necessary to download the data:

1. Data to replicate the results in the [Fragile Families Challenge](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1915006117) comes from the "Replication materials for Measuring the predictability of life outcomes using a scientific mass collaboration" site on the Harvard Dataverse, available [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?id=3743481).
2. Data from the Millenium Cohort Study which is necessary to replicate [the paper](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=QQBbWokAAAAJ&citation_for_view=QQBbWokAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC) comes from [here](https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/millennium-cohort-study) but requires a little pre-processing as per Dr. Orben's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/OrbenAmy/NHB_2019) on that paper.
